# EagleEye

EagleEye is WIP machine learning project for tracking and predicting cryptocurrency trends and, eventually, automated trading.

## The state of the project

Currently, work on this project is limited to constructing and organising datasets. The following tasks (among others) need to be completed before moving on to actually creating and training models:

- [ ] Bulk ingest of large CSV OHLCV datasets like [CryptoDataDownload](https://www.cryptodatadownload.com/data/) and [CryptoTick](https://www.cryptotick.com/)
- [ ] Polishing the (currently basic) binary dataset storage format
- [ ] Finalizing the CLI arguments and API
